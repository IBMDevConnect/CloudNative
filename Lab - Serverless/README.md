# Create, expose and secure a serverless function as an API

In this lab we will learn how to use IBM Visual Recognition service to classify images and how to use IBM Cloud Functions create a serverless action. Finally, we will also learn how to use the API Gateway service to securely expose the serverless function by creating and testing an API Endpoint.
